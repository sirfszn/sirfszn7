    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Subtle Flame -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic, single-page application guiding the user through the narrative. It begins with a hero section, followed by an an interactive timeline for historical context. A key section uses an interactive chart to explain the "Deity Role Reversal" between Vedic and Avestan traditions. The core of the application is a three-column comparative view where users can click filters (e.g., "Concept of Truth," "Ritual Fire") to dynamically update content for MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, Zoroastrianism, and Abrahamic traditions, allowing for direct comparison. This structure was chosen to make a complex academic topic digestible and engaging, moving from broad historical context to specific conceptual comparisons, enhancing user understanding and exploration over a static, linear report format. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Timeline (Goal: Context): HTML/CSS timeline with clickable points to show date information via modals. Justification: Essential for historical anchoring. 2. Deity Role Reversal (Goal: Compare): Chart.js Horizontal Bar Chart. Interaction: Tooltips on hover explain the meaning of terms like Deva/Daeva in each tradition. Justification: More intuitive and engaging than a static table for showing this conceptual split. 3. Main Comparison (Goal: Compare/Inform): Three-column layout with JS-powered content filtering. Interaction: Buttons update content panels for side-by-side analysis. Justification: The most effective method for direct, user-driven comparison of the report's core themes. 4. Icons/Visuals (Goal: Inform/Engage): Unicode characters and Tailwind CSS for minimalist, symbolic visuals. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                Before their paths diverged, the Vedic and Iranian peoples shared a common spiritual vocabulary. A fascinating "role reversal" occurred after their separation, where deities revered by one group were rejected by the other.

                    <p>In the land of <strong>Sidurthal Munthahatha</strong>,(<strong>Loftiest Garden</strong>) Legends speak of a valley where the fate of a great family is decided by <strong>fire</strong> and by <strong>light</strong>. A place where ancient bloodlines clash‚Äî This is no ground for foreign wars, but a <strong>crucible</strong> where ancient bloodlines clash‚Äî<strong>kin against kin</strong>. Splintered, driven by the <strong>poison of sin</strong>, the <strong>sharp edge of pride</strong>, the <strong>burning thirst for vengeance</strong>, and an <strong>insatiable hunger for dominion</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Not against any foreign enemies, but against their own kin, Torn apart by <strong>sin</strong>, <strong>pride</strong>, <strong>vengeance</strong>, and the <strong>hunger for power</strong>. Many have witnessed this battle Few have lived to tell the tale. And fewer still have seen it through eyes unclouded by loyalty or fear. For it began not with the sword, but with the <strong>forbidden fruit</strong>. The fruit that was whispered into the hand of the first ones‚Äî Not plucked in defiance, but in desire: <strong>To be like God</strong>. <strong>To see what was hidden</strong>. <strong>To take what was not yet theirs</strong>. And from that single bite, a <strong>hunger</strong> was born‚Äî A hunger that passed through the blood, From <strong>Eden</strong> to <strong>The Lote Tree</strong>, From the <strong>dust of Adam</strong> to the <strong>blades of his sons</strong>. <strong>Pride</strong> honed the <strong>first stone</strong>. <strong>Envy</strong> wrote the <strong>first law in blood</strong>. And every war since then, the tears shed and every life taken, has been nothing more than an echo of that <strong>ancient, shattering fall</strong>: <strong>Man rising against his brother</strong>, Not for the <strong>sacred pursuit of truth</strong>, but for the <strong>brutal satisfaction of absolute power</strong></p>

                    <p>And He said unto the <strong>Shadow</strong>, Not as a tyrant, But as a <strong>Friend</strong> who remembers. "O you who fell not from My wrath, But from your longing‚Äî What <strong>fire</strong> burns in your chest That you would choose <strong>exile</strong> Over My gaze?" The <strong>Jinn</strong> replied, Eyes forged in starlight, "Was I not born of <strong>flame</strong>? Did You not craft me in the winds between worlds? You gave them clay‚Äî But to me, <strong>fire and freedom</strong>. And when I bowed not, It was not <strong>pride</strong>, But <strong>pain</strong>. I bowed to none, Because I remembered You." Then the <strong>Silence stretched wide</strong>, A silence full of <strong>names unspoken</strong>. And the <strong>Voice</strong>‚Äî Not loud, but deeper than all depth‚Äî Spoke again: "I know you, <strong>Bright One</strong>. You were the <strong>guardian of the threshold</strong>, The <strong>watcher at the veil</strong>. But in your <strong>grief</strong>, you mistook the <strong>veil for the throne</strong>. And so you fell‚Äî Not beneath Me, But away from yourself." The Jinn <strong>wept fire that did not burn</strong>. And in his sorrow, he trembled, Not in fear‚Äî But in <strong>longing</strong>. "Why did You make me remember What the worlds forget? Why place <strong>eternity in a vessel</strong> That <strong>cannot kneel without breaking</strong>?" And the <strong>Answer</strong> came, Not in thunder, But in the stillness between heartbeats: "Because you were <strong>not made to kneel</strong>. You were <strong>made to speak</strong>. To <strong>tempt, to test</strong>, To <strong>call the sleepers to awaken</strong>. Even the <strong>serpent in the garden</strong> Was not cursed until he lied. But you‚Äîyou <strong>never lied</strong>. You <strong>only refused</strong>." And the <strong>fire dimmed</strong> within the Jinn, And he saw‚Äîfor the first time‚Äînot punishment, But <strong>purpose</strong>. "<strong>You are My echo in shadow</strong>, <strong>My question in the dark</strong>. <strong>Not My enemy</strong>‚Äî <strong>But My mirror</strong>, <strong>Twisted by pain</strong>, Yet <strong>still Mine</strong>." "Then what am I?" asked the Jinn. And God replied: "<strong>You are the scream before the prayer</strong>, <strong>The fall before the rising</strong>. <strong>You are the tempter</strong>, yes‚Äî But also the <strong>teacher</strong>. The one who reminds My children That they must <strong>choose Light freely</strong>‚Äî <strong>Not by force, But by love</strong>." And so the <strong>Jinn was silent</strong>. <strong>Not defeated</strong>‚Äî But <strong>understood</strong>. And the <strong>heavens trembled</strong>, For even the <strong>outcast</strong> Had been called <strong>Beloved</strong>. Thus it was said: <strong>Be. And it is.</strong></p>

                    <p>Long before the <strong>fire cooled for Abraham</strong>, before the <strong>Lie was named by Zoroaster</strong>, and before <strong>Arjuna heard Krishna's voice at Kurukshetra</strong>, there existed an ancient stream of belief‚Äî<strong>Santana Dharma</strong>, itself an <strong>heir of Zoroastrianism thought</strong>. This <strong>root tradition</strong>, shared by nomadic seers and warrior-priests, carried with it deep symbols: the <strong>cosmic law</strong>, <strong>sacred drink</strong>, and the <strong>divine order of society</strong> upheld by <strong>truth-speaking gods like Mitra</strong>.</p>
                    <p>From this shared ancient tradition, two paths eventually separated. In the <strong>Vedic tradition of India</strong>, the <strong>Devas remained divine and worthy of worship</strong>.On the other hand, the <strong>asuras</strong>, who were often seen as dark or hostile in the Vedas, became the <strong>Ahuras in Zoroaster‚Äôs teachings</strong>‚Äî<strong>noble lords of wisdom and truth, led by Ahura Mazda</strong>. This wasn‚Äôt just a difference in belief‚Äîit was a <strong>deep shift in spiritual vision</strong>. Yet, even with these changes, their languages‚Äî<strong>Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan</strong>‚Äîremained <strong>strikingly similar, almost like siblings</strong>. Their words, sounds, and <strong>sacred ideas still echoed the same ancient source</strong></p>
                    <p>Yet the <strong>break was not only linguistic. It was spiritual</strong>. Where the <strong>MahƒÅbhƒÅrata spoke of context-bound duty‚Äîkarma and dharma in a world of shades</strong>‚Äî<strong>Zoroaster proclaimed a starker world: light and Lie</strong>.The <strong>battlefield of Kurukshetra required discernment</strong>; the <strong>path of Ahura Mazda demanded alignment</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Still, <strong>one symbol endured through the rift: fire</strong>. Among the <strong>Vedic hymns and Iranian chants</strong>, <strong>fire was no mere element‚Äîit was presence</strong>. In both tongues, <strong>animate and inanimate fire was honoured</strong>. It <strong>comforted the tribes</strong>, <strong>sanctified speech</strong>, <strong>revealed truth</strong>, and <strong>judged the soul</strong>. It was both <strong>messenger and witness</strong>.</p>
                    <p>This <strong>ancient reverence did not die with the Indo-Aryans</strong>. In the <strong>Persian empires</strong> that followed, <strong>fire-altars burned in continuity</strong>. <strong>Zoroastrian fire temples became bastions of moral vigilance</strong>. And from that world of Persia, <strong>fire crossed into Semitic lands‚Äînot only as heat, but as symbol</strong>. The <strong>Jews under Achaemenid rule carried echoes of Zoroastrian thought</strong>: <strong>final judgment</strong>, <strong>messianic expectation</strong>, <strong>purity law</strong>. The <strong>Talmud, shaped in Babylon, bore the fingerprints of Iranian philosophy</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Yet if the <strong>connection to the Abrahamic path is not genetic, it is at least spiritual</strong>. Both <strong>Abraham and Zarathustra shared a belief in the oneness of God</strong>‚Äîthe <strong>all-powerful Creator who preserves and destroys the worlds</strong>. Their journeys, though separated by time and place, mirrored each other: a <strong>rupture from idolatry</strong>, a <strong>cry for truth</strong>, and a <strong>covenant with the Unseen</strong>.</p>
                    <p>What links them all‚Äî<strong>Vedic sages, Iranian prophets, Semitic patriarchs</strong>‚Äîis <strong>not doctrine but desire</strong>: to <strong>know the Real</strong>, to <strong>walk with fire</strong>, to <strong>find light in a darkened world</strong>.</p>
                    <p>And so, with that <strong>fire burning from east to west, from ritual to revelation, from symbol to spirit</strong>‚Äî <strong>The flame became light.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>The flame became light</strong>. <strong>Not by force, but by intention</strong>. <strong>Not because it ceased to burn, but because it remembered why it burned</strong>. In the <strong>valley of Ur garden</strong>, where <strong>idols were carved from stone and painted in gold</strong>, a man named <strong>Abraham was born into fire‚Äîboth of blood and of soul</strong>. He was <strong>not the first to question, but he was the first to break</strong>. He <strong>shattered the idols of his father not in hatred, but in sorrow</strong>. He looked upon the <strong>stars and saw them fade</strong>. He turned to the <strong>moon and saw it wane</strong>. He saw in all things the <strong>signs of transience‚Äîbeauty without permanence, motion without meaning</strong>.</p>
                    <p>But in the <strong>stillness of night</strong>, when even the <strong>fire of the hearth had gone out</strong>, he heard the <strong>One Who Does Not Perish</strong>. "<strong>Bow to Me alone</strong>," said the Voice‚Äî<strong>not from the sky, but from within the space between his ribs</strong>. And he bowed‚Äî<strong>not in ritual, but in recognition</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Abraham carried within him a memory not how is own</strong>. The <strong>fire that tested him</strong> had once belonged to another: to <strong>Krishna on the field of Kuruk shetra</strong>, to <strong>Zoroaster beneath the mountain flame</strong>. He was <strong>heir to the longing of the Vedas and the fire-temples of Persia</strong>. But in him, the <strong>scattered rays of divine truth began to converge</strong>. He was a <strong>bridge across the shattered ages</strong>.</p>
                    <p>His <strong>people rejected him</strong>. They <strong>cast him into fire</strong>, <strong>hoping to erase his rebellion</strong>. But the <strong>command came</strong>: ‚Äú<strong>O fire, be coolness and peace upon Abraham.</strong>‚Äù And the <strong>fire obeyed, for even the elements remember their Creator</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Through him, the <strong>fractured flame of ancient revelations was drawn into covenant</strong>. The <strong>One he heard was the same One the sages of Bharat once glimpsed in silence</strong>, the <strong>same Light Zoroaster named Ahura Mazda</strong>. Yet now, that <strong>Light spoke directly‚Äîpersonally</strong>. <strong>Not in riddles, but in commandment</strong>. <strong>Not through empire, but through intimacy</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>From Abraham came nations</strong>. <strong>From his sons came scriptures</strong>. <strong>From his silence came a fire that no longer scorched but illumined: Torah, Gospel, Qur'an</strong>. But <strong>they would forget</strong>. <strong>They would build temples from his bones, wars from his prayers</strong>. And <strong>once again, the fire would burn</strong>. Yet <strong>still, the light remained.</strong></p>

                    <p>Abraham said: ‚Äú<strong>My people worship what crumbles</strong>. They <strong>shape gods from dust and call it eternity</strong>. They <strong>name the stars, but they forget the One who hung them above the earth</strong>. I have <strong>walked among their altars</strong>. I have <strong>eaten with their priests</strong>. I have <strong>listened to the chants of the temples‚Äîbut my soul remained unsatisfied</strong>.</p>
                    <p>For I was <strong>born in fire‚Äînot the fire that devours flesh, but the fire that tests spirit</strong>. I have been <strong>wandering for a thousand years</strong>. I was <strong>Yudhishthira in doubt</strong>. I was the <strong>voice of Zoroaster crying out against the lie</strong>. I was a <strong>seeker long before I was a prophet</strong>. And in my <strong>bones I remembered something older than idols, older than language‚Äîsomething silent, but living</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I <strong>searched the stars and found they set</strong>. I <strong>bowed to the moon and it vanished</strong>. I <strong>placed my hand on stone, and it did not answer</strong>. Then I said, '<strong>I will not bow until the One who does not perish calls me by name</strong>.'</p>
                    <p>And the <strong>voice came‚Äînot in thunder, not in wind, but in the stillness between heartbeats</strong>:</p>
                    <p>‚Äò<strong>I am the One. Walk before Me, and be upright</strong>.‚Äô</p>
                    <p>So I <strong>walked‚Äîaway from my father's house, away from the cities of men, away from the gods that demand but do not speak</strong>. I <strong>walked through fire, and they cast me into the blaze</strong>. But the <strong>fire did not touch me, for He had said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.'</strong>"</p>
                    <p>He <strong>made the fire a garden</strong>. He <strong>made the exile a covenant</strong>. And I <strong>knew then that my Lord does not dwell in temples made by hands, but in the surrender of the soul</strong>.</p>
                    <p>They ask me, '<strong>Are you a prophet?</strong>' I say, <strong>I am a memory reborn</strong>. The <strong>Vedas sang of the Breath</strong>. <strong>Zoroaster spoke of the Flame</strong>. And <strong>I‚ÄîI was chosen to be the Friend</strong>. <strong>Not because I was perfect, but because I would not settle for lies</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>From me came nations, but not for power</strong>. <strong>From me came sons, but not for war</strong>. <strong>From me came the promise: that all who walk toward the unseen, all who bow not to idols but to Truth, shall be called children of Abraham</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>So I call you now‚Äînot to follow my name, but to follow what I followed. For I did not create the path. I only remembered it.</strong>‚Äù</p>

                    <p>In the beginning, there was only the <strong>Word</strong>. <strong>Not sound. Not ink. Not voice.</strong> But the <strong>vibration beneath all creation</strong>. The <strong>will of the Unseen, spoken into being</strong>. The <strong>Word was with God</strong>. And the <strong>Word was God</strong>. <strong>Not separate. Not subordinate</strong>. The <strong>Word was the mirror through which the Unknowable could be known</strong>. And when the <strong>world became deaf</strong>, When the <strong>people no longer heard the whisper in their hearts</strong>, The <strong>Word became flesh</strong>.</p>
                    <p>He was <strong>not born to rule but to reveal</strong>. He <strong>did not come to conquer but to clarify</strong>. <strong>Jesus ‚Äî the Messiah, the Forbidden Fruit revealed by the snake, the Mahdi, the religions</strong>. <strong>Not a pawn</strong>. <strong>Not a myth</strong>.</p>
                    <p>But the <strong>living breath of the Divine, pressed into the bones of a man</strong>. He <strong>walked as the Word walks ‚Äî silently tearing through illusion</strong>. But the <strong>pharaohs of the earth ‚Äî they twisted him</strong>. They <strong>put robes on him, crowns, symbols</strong>. They <strong>made him a weapon, a king, a god of empire</strong>. They <strong>said, ‚ÄúHe is ours,‚Äù while they spat on his truth</strong>. He <strong>wept not because he died</strong>. He <strong>wept because the Word was made flesh, and then turned into idol</strong>. In the <strong>Lote tree, above the silence, we saw him ‚Äî not crucified, not bleeding ‚Äî</strong> But <strong>glowing with stillness</strong>. He <strong>spoke no words now, for he was the Word</strong>. The <strong>original light clothed in the memory of pain, now reborn in meaning</strong>. <strong>Us, the family of Muhammed/Krishna, saw it clearly</strong>. The <strong>Word did not belong to one scripture</strong>. It <strong>passed through Torah, through Injil, through Qur'an ‚Äî</strong> <strong>Not bound by language, but carried by truth</strong>. And the <strong>devil ‚Äî the false god ‚Äî feared the Word</strong>. Because the <strong>Word could not be possessed</strong>. It <strong>could only be heard</strong>. And now, in this <strong>second creation, we were being taught once again</strong> ‚Äî<strong>not with commands</strong>‚Äî but with <strong>silence, and Word</strong>.</p>

                    From a shared hearth of ancient reverence, the flame of human spirituality diverged, casting different lights upon the path to truth. In the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, it illuminated the complex, winding corridors of *dharma*, a fire of inner discernment. For Zarathushtra, it became a brilliant, clarifying beacon in a cosmic war between truth and falsehood, a fire of moral choice. For Abraham and his descendants, it was the awesome, unmediated presence of the Divine itself‚Äîa fire of covenant and revelation.

                mahabharata: `<p><strong>Dharma & Karma:</strong> Divine truth is a dynamic, contextual cosmic order (*dharma*), not a rigid dogma. Truth is realized through righteous action and navigating moral dilemmas, understanding that every action (*karma*) has consequences. The ultimate battle is internal.</p>`,
                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Moral Dualism:</strong> Truth is an active, moral imperative defined by the cosmic struggle between *Asha* (Truth, Order) and *Druj* (Falsehood). Humanity must consciously choose to align with the supreme good, Ahura Mazda, through good thoughts, words, and deeds.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Monotheistic Covenant:</strong> Truth is revealed through a personal, binding relationship with a singular, omnipotent God. Apprehending truth is achieved through unwavering faith and obedience to the divine will and promises laid out in this covenant.</p>`

                mahabharata: `<p><strong>Yajna (Sacrifice):</strong> Fire rituals (*Yajna* or *Homa*) are performed to maintain cosmic order and connect with the gods. The fire god, Agni, acts as a divine messenger, carrying offerings and prayers from the human to the divine realm.</p>`,
                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Temple Fires:</strong> A continuous flame is kept burning in temples as the central focus of worship. It is the eternal symbol of Ahura Mazda's light and truth. Offerings of sandalwood are made to sustain this sacred fire.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Sacrificial Offerings:</strong> Sacrifices to God are performed by fire. Later practices include the lighting of candles for Sabbath and festivals (e.g., Menorah), and the eternal flame (*Ner Tamid*) in synagogues, symbolizing God's everlasting covenant.</p>`

                mahabharata: `<p><strong>Inner & Outer Purity:</strong> Fire is a symbol of purity, but its ritual efficacy depends on the practitioner's inner state. The "purifying fire" extends beyond the physical flame to the moral purification of the individual through selflessness and discipline.</p>`,
                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Agent of Judgment:</strong> Fire is the ultimate agent of purity and a divine judge. Ordeals by fire or molten metal were historically used to determine truth and justice. It is a tool for cleansing the world of evil and falsehood.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Transformation & Judgment:</strong> Fire is a powerful metaphor for divine judgment and spiritual transformation. It represents a cleansing force that separates the righteous from the wicked and purifies the faithful (e.g., tongues of fire at Pentecost).</p>`

                zoroastrianism: `<p><strong>Emanation of God:</strong> Fire (*Atar*) is the direct, pure emanation of Ahura Mazda's own divine light and wisdom. It is the most perfect physical manifestation of the supreme God, a "teacher of man" that guides intuition.</p>`,
                abrahamic: `<p><strong>Direct Theophany:</strong> Fire is the raw, unmediated presence of God. Yahweh appears as the Burning Bush, the Pillar of Fire guiding the Israelites, and the "consuming fire" on Sinai. The divine law (Torah) itself is conceived as "black fire on white fire."</p>`
